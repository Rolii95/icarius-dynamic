# Calculating the ROI of HR Automation

Automation can transform the HR service experience, but executives demand proof that investment is worthwhile. This guide explains how to capture the total value of automation so finance, HR, and IT align on the business case.

## Baseline the cost to serve

- Map end-to-end processes and tally human effort, vendor spend, and error remediation costs.
- Segment workload by request type—transactions, advice, onboarding—so you know where automation shifts the dial.
- Capture employee and manager sentiment to highlight the qualitative pain automation can relieve.

## Model the financial upside

1. Translate hours saved into monetary value using fully loaded labour rates.
2. Account for quality uplift, such as fewer compliance breaches or reduced rework.
3. Include platform optimisation, like retiring redundant licences or renegotiating support tiers.

## Measure experience and risk reduction

Automation also improves resilience:

- Faster resolution times lift NPS and decrease repeat tickets.
- Standardised workflows reduce regulatory risk and audit findings.
- Digital trails create insight for continuous improvement.

Quantify these benefits with before/after surveys, SLA reports, and control testing.

## Build an ROI narrative leaders believe

Frame your business case around:

- **Strategic goals:** Link automation to growth, compliance, or employee experience priorities.
- **Value roadmap:** Show when savings land and how you will reinvest capacity.
- **Governance:** Explain how you will monitor automation, capture lessons, and evolve service design.
