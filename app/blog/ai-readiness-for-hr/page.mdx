# AI Readiness for HR

HR leaders are under pressure to “do something with AI,” yet many organisations lack the foundations that keep pilots compliant and credible. Use this readiness checklist to make sure your next experiment is safe, ethical, and business-aligned.

## Data you can trust

- **Inventory sensitive datasets** and confirm lawful processing bases with legal and privacy teams.
- **Establish quality gates** so records used for training or inference meet accuracy thresholds.
- **Define retention and deletion policies** before you store any derived data from AI services.

When data stewards lead this effort, your pilot inherits repeatable governance that scales across use cases.

## Policies that guide experimentation

1. Draft an AI acceptable-use policy that explains where human review is mandatory.
2. Map regulatory obligations—GDPR, Works Council agreements, industry codes—to each proposed use case.
3. Stand up a lightweight review board blending HR, legal, IT, and employee representatives.

This oversight keeps experimentation aligned with organisational values while ensuring audit readiness.

## Skills and enablement

- Build role-based enablement so HRBPs, COEs, and operations teams know how AI supports their workflows.
- Clarify escalation paths when outputs look biased, inaccurate, or incomplete.
- Celebrate early adopters who use AI responsibly to solve real employee problems.

## Pilot selection and measurement

Choose pilots that combine high-impact use cases with manageable risk—for example, drafting knowledge articles, triaging service tickets, or supporting recruiter outreach. Define success metrics across accuracy, cycle time, employee experience, and trust.

Use pre/post baselines and qualitative feedback to tell a clear story about value when you brief executives.
