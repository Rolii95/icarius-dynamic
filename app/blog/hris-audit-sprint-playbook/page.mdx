A focused HRIS audit sprint lets people, process, and platform leaders align around facts fast. This playbook breaks the sprint into pragmatic milestones that your PMO can slot directly into a delivery plan.

## Sprint overview and charter

- **Sprint duration:** 4–6 weeks with a lightweight core team and rotating SMEs.
- **Objectives:** Capture the current-state operating model, quantify risk, and prioritise remediations that unlock business outcomes.
- **Outputs:** Executive-ready findings deck, remediation roadmap, and a living backlog that feeds future projects.

Document these components in a simple charter so every stakeholder understands scope, cadence, and decision points before discovery begins.

## Week 1–2: Discovery and systems inventory

1. **Stakeholder interviews** covering HR operations, payroll, finance, compliance, IT security, and change partners.
2. **Data flow mapping** to visualise integrations, data hand-offs, and manual workarounds.
3. **Control testing** for access, segregation of duties, and audit logging.

Synthesize insights daily to keep traction. A shared mural or whiteboard keeps observations transparent for distributed teams.

## Week 3–4: Diagnostics and scoring

Create a scoring model across availability, compliance, user experience, data integrity, and cost to serve. Weight each dimension against enterprise OKRs so recommendations clearly link to value. Summaries should include:

- Critical incidents and their quantified impact.
- Process and policy friction that introduces risk.
- Technology constraints that block automation or analytics.

Use the scores to focus leadership on the top five systemic gaps rather than isolated issues.

## Week 5–6: Remediation plan and activation

Translate the diagnostics into an actionable roadmap:

- **Quick wins:** Fixes executable within 30 days with existing resources.
- **Strategic initiatives:** Multi-quarter investments with measurable benefits.
- **Operating rhythm:** Governance, KPIs, and cadence to track delivery.

Pair each initiative with owners, dependencies, and budget estimates. Socialise recommendations through working sessions rather than a single readout to secure buy-in faster.

### Keep momentum after your sprint

Use the sprint backlog as the nucleus of your quarterly planning and revisit the scoring model every six months to prevent drift. We share playbook updates, tooling templates, and audit benchmarks in our insights newsletter.
