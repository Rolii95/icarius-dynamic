When HR technology programmes stall, executives lose confidence fast. This 30-day jumpstart framework resets cadence, rebuilds trust, and positions your transformation to deliver recognisable wins before the next steering committee.

## Day 1–7: Clarity and control

- **Reconfirm mandate:** Align scope, success metrics, and decision rights with your executive sponsors.
- **Stabilise ceremonies:** Reinstate daily stand-ups, weekly demos, and backlog grooming focused on measurable progress.
- **Surface blockers:** Catalogue dependencies, vendor gaps, and resource constraints with owners and due dates.

Pair your findings with a one-page momentum scorecard so leadership can see the baseline you are working from.

## Day 8–15: Value-aligned backlog

1. Group backlog items into value themes tied to employee, manager, or HR outcomes.
2. Re-estimate effort and confidence to highlight where investment accelerates impact.
3. Create demo-ready slices for the most strategic themes and prepare enablement to celebrate the win.

## Day 16–23: Delivery discipline

Focus on execution hygiene:

- Rebuild programme RAID logs with clear escalation paths.
- Introduce bi-weekly portfolio reviews with finance and change partners.
- Standardise status reporting across workstreams with consistent green/amber/red criteria.

These routines calm the noise while you deliver tangible progress.

## Day 24–30: Executive storytelling

Translate momentum into a narrative sponsors can retell:

- Anchor on the original mandate and how the programme now supports it.
- Showcase the tangible outcomes produced during the jumpstart.
- Outline the next 60–90 day plan, highlighting how you will manage remaining risk.

Close with a working session rather than a formal readout so leaders co-create the path forward.
